# SEA:ME with Capgemini


# Overview

SEA:ME is an open education curriculum program focused on automotive and mobility software engineering. The program is designed to provide hands-on, project-based learning opportunities for the next generation of automotive software engineers.

SEA:ME and Capgemini could collaborate on developing educational projects for students in the automotive and mobility sector. Capgemini's expertise in personalization features, voice assistant systems, assisted driving technologies, software-defined vehicles, and mobility as a service (MaaS) could be shared to develop hands-on projects. These projects could include personalization in MaaS using K8s and cloud solutions, a voice assistant system for cars, and software-defined steering, braking, and acceleration systems.


# Potential work areas



1. **Personalization** features in cars: Capgemini could provide educational materials and hands-on projects to teach students how to develop personalized features for cars, such as customized dashboard displays, in-car entertainment systems, and seating adjustments that adapt to individual drivers.
2. Voice assistant systems: Capgemini could share their expertise in **developing voice assistant systems** for cars, and provide guidance on how to integrate these systems with other in-car technologies, such as GPS navigation and entertainment systems.
3. Assisted driving technologies: Capgemini could provide educational materials and projects that teach students about the latest assisted driving technologies, such as **adaptive cruise control**, lane keeping assistance, and automatic emergency braking.
4. Software-defined vehicles: Capgemini could share their knowledge and expertise in developing software-defined vehicles, which are cars that rely on software to control various aspects of the driving experience. This could include teaching students about **software-defined steering, braking, and acceleration**, as well as how to develop software to manage various vehicle sensors and control systems.
5. Mobility as a service (MaaS): Capgemini could provide educational materials and hands-on projects to teach students about the latest trends in MaaS, such as ride-sharing platforms, on-demand transportation services, and integrated mobility solutions that combine different modes of transportation. This could include teaching students how to develop software that supports these platforms and services, as well as how to design user experiences that optimize mobility solutions for individual users.


# Potential educational projects & requirements



1. **Personalization in MaaS** (using K8s and cloud solutions)
    1. Develop a platform that allows users to customize their transportation preferences, such as preferred modes of transportation, routes, and pick-up/drop-off locations.
    2. Implement a cloud-based solution that can process user data and provide personalized transportation recommendations based on individual user preferences and real-time traffic data.
    3. Use Kubernetes (K8s) to manage the deployment and scaling of the platform across multiple cloud instances, ensuring high availability and efficient resource usage.
2. **Voice assistant system for car**
    4. Develop a voice assistant system that can recognize and respond to natural language commands related to in-car features, such as climate control, entertainment systems, and navigation.
    5. Implement a machine learning model to improve the accuracy and reliability of voice recognition and natural language processing.
    6. Integrate the voice assistant system with other in-car technologies, such as GPS navigation and climate control, to provide a seamless user experience.
3. **Software-defined steering, braking, and acceleration systems**
    7. Develop a software-defined system for steering, braking, and acceleration that relies on sensors and machine learning algorithms to improve driving performance and safety.
    8. Implement algorithms that can predict and respond to changing road conditions, such as curves, hills, and obstacles.
    9. Use software-defined systems to enable advanced assisted driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistance.
