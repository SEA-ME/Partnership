# SEA:ME with Eclipse Foundation


# Overview

SEA:ME is an open education curriculum program focused on automotive and mobility software engineering. The program is designed to provide hands-on, project-based learning opportunities for the next generation of automotive software engineers.

The Eclipse Foundation is a non-profit organization that hosts open-source projects and provides a platform for collaboration and innovation in the software industry. The Eclipse Foundation SdV has a focus on developer tools, IoT, and open-source software governance to build the software defined vehicle architecture with a solid baseline framework.


# Key Activities



* **Educational Material Development**: The SEA:ME provides the ecosystem/platform to build PoC of the projects in the Eclipse Foundation project. The Eclipse Foundation will provide expertise and resources to support SEA:ME in developing educational material related to software development, IoT, and open-source software governance. This will include providing guidance on best practices, contributing to the development of educational content, and providing access to relevant tools and resources.
* **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**: SEA:ME and the Eclipse Foundation will collaborate and share knowledge in the areas of SdV software development and IoT. This will include participation in relevant events and initiatives.
* **Joint Projects and Initiatives**: SEA:ME and the Eclipse Foundation will explore opportunities to develop joint projects and initiatives that benefit both organizations. This may include joint hackathons or other events, joint research initiatives, or joint advocacy efforts related to SdV software development and IoT.


# Potential work areas

# Leda + Velocitas

The goal of the project is to help participants understand how Leda and Velocitas can work together to develop software-defined vehicle applications. 

The sample application can be a simple **dashboard that displays real-time data from sensors on the vehicle, such as speed, temperature, and battery level**.

To get started, participants can follow these steps:



1. Install/setup the Leda and Velocitas plugins. Set up a development environment for both projects.
2. Build a Docker container for the application using Leda recipes and package definitions
3. Deploy the container to a target platform using Velocitas pipelines and tools
4. Test and debug the application using Eclipse debugging tools and Velocitas runtime monitoring
5. Participants can work in pairs or small teams to share knowledge and collaborate on the project. They can also contribute back to the Leda and Velocitas projects by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or code contributions.


# ArchE + SommR

An interesting hands-on project idea that can help peer learning of Eclipse ArchE and Eclipse SommR projects could be to create a sample automotive application that utilizes both projects.

The goal of the project is to help participants understand how ArchE and SommR can work together to develop automotive software applications. The sample application can be a **simple control system that communicates between different ECUs using the SomeIP protocol and is modeled using the ArchE tool**.

To get started, participants can follow these steps:



1. Install/setup the ArchE and SommR plugins. Set up a development environment for both projects.
2. Create an architecture model using ArchE that represents the different ECUs and their interconnections in the vehicle
3. Generate code from the model using ArchE and implement the application logic in the generated code
4. Use SommR to implement the SomeIP protocol communication between the ECUs
5. Test and debug the application using Eclipse debugging tools and SommR runtime monitoring
6. Participants can work in pairs or small teams to share knowledge and collaborate on the project. They can also contribute back to the ArchE and SommR projects by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or code contributions.
