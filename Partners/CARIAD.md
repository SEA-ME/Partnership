# SEA:ME with CARIAD


# Overview

SEA:ME is an open education curriculum program focused on automotive and mobility software engineering. The program is designed to provide hands-on, project-based learning opportunities for the next generation of automotive software engineers.

SEA:ME and CARIAD can collaborate to introduce CARIAD's latest work in automotive and mobility sectors, such as VW.OS, VW.AC, The Big Loop, intelligent cockpit, automated driving, and data-driven development, into SEA:ME's hands-on project-based curriculum. This collaboration can result in developing exciting educational projects that can benefit both SEA:ME students and CARIAD's research and development initiatives.


# Potential work areas



1. Developing Applications on VW.OS - Students can learn how to develop and test applications on VW.OS, which is the software basis that coordinates all types of applications within Volkswagen vehicles. Projects could include **developing a new infotainment app** or integrating an existing app onto VW.OS.
2. Developing Services on VW.AC - Students can learn how to develop and test services on VW.AC, which provides a safe and scalable foundation for connected and autonomous vehicles. Projects could include **developing a new remote service** or integrating an existing service onto VW.AC.
3. The Big Loop Analysis - Students can analyze data from millions of cars on the road worldwide through The Big Loop, a platform that enables the development of new features and services tailored to user needs. Projects could include **analyzing data to identify trends and developing new features based on those trends**.
4. Intelligent Cockpit Design - Students can design and test the user interface of the **intelligent cockpit**, which is a key component of Volkswagen's vision for future mobility. Projects could include designing a new feature or optimizing an existing feature for the cockpit.
5. Automated Driving Systems Development - Students can learn how to develop and test automated driving systems, which are an important component of Volkswagen's future mobility vision. Projects could include **developing new algorithms or optimizing existing algorithms for automated driving systems**.
6. Cybersecurity - Students can learn about cybersecurity and how it applies to the development of automotive software. Projects could include **developing and testing new security measures to protect Volkswagen vehicles from cyber threats**.


# Potential educational projects & requirements



1. **VW.OS-based Application Development**: The project will involve developing applications for the Volkswagen Operating System (VW.OS), which will be the software basis for Volkswagen's upcoming vehicles. The project will require students to understand the architecture of VW.OS, learn the development process for VW.OS-based applications, and develop a functional application that runs on VW.OS.
2. **Automated Driving Simulation**: This project will involve developing a simulation environment for automated driving systems. Students will learn the principles of automated driving systems, simulate various driving scenarios using CARIAD's automated driving system, and test the system's performance. 
3. **Data-Driven Development**: The project will involve the development of a data-driven development process for automotive software. Students will learn how to collect, process, and analyze data from vehicles to improve the development process. 
4. **Intelligent Cockpit Design**: This project will involve designing an intelligent cockpit for Volkswagen's upcoming vehicles. Students will learn the principles of human-computer interaction, design the user interface for the cockpit, and integrate various functions such as navigation, entertainment, and vehicle control.
5. **Big Loop Analytics**: This project will involve analyzing the data collected from Volkswagen vehicles to develop new features and services. Students will learn how to analyze big data, identify trends, and develop new features that meet customers' needs. 
6. **VW.AC-based Service Development**: This project will involve developing new services for Volkswagen's Automotive Cloud (VW.AC). Students will learn how to use VW.AC's data processing capabilities, develop new services, and integrate them into Volkswagen's vehicles. 
7. **Cybersecurity** in Automotive Software: This project will involve developing a cybersecurity framework for automotive software. Students will learn about the various cybersecurity threats to automotive software, develop a cybersecurity framework, and test the framework against various attacks.
